# Image Captioning and Tagging with Google Gemini
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04d98678-9a8d-4bb0-bad6-a6b104e54a99)

This project is a web application that uses the Google Gemini Cloud Vision API to analyze images and generate descriptive tags based on the content of the uploaded images. Additionally, the application is designed to generate captions and describe what's happening in the photos; however, this feature is currently a work in progress (WIP).

## Live Demo

You can try out the live version of the application [here](https://image-captioning-with-gemini.onrender.com/).

## Features

- **Tag Generation**: Upload an image, and the application will generate relevant tags that describe the contents of the image.
- **Caption Generation (WIP)**: The application is being developed to generate captions and detailed descriptions of what's happening in the image.
- **Beautiful UI**: The user interface is elegantly crafted using just CSS, ensuring a smooth and visually appealing experience.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The core programming language used for backend development.
- **Flask**: A lightweight WSGI web application framework used to build the web server.
- **Google Gemini Cloud Vision API**: A powerful image analysis API from Google, used to generate tags and (soon) captions for the images.
- **Render**: The platform where the application is hosted.
- **CSS**: Used to create a beautiful and responsive user interface.
